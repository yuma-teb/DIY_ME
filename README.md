# Git Flow Method
I used the Git Flow method for DIY Material project. This method helped me to manage my code changes effectively.

### 1. Main Branch
* Represents the stable and production-ready version.
  
### 2. Develop Branch
* Serves as the integration branch for ongoing development.
* Any feature that created are merged into develop branch
* Represents the latest state of the application with features being developed.
  
### 3. Feature Branches
* Responsible for app features
* 
### 4. Release Branches
* To prepare a new version of todo app for release:
    * Create a release branch from the develop branch.
    * Perform testing, bug fixes, and any final adjustments specific to the release.

### 5. Bugfix Branches
* If the code changes made from the feature branch were rejected after a release, sprint or demo, any necessary fixes after that should be done on the bugfix branch.

### 6. Hotfix Branches
* used to quickly patch production releases. Hotfix branches are a lot like release branches and feature branches except they're based on main instead of develop.
